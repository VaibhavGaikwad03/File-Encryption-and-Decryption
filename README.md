# File Encryption and Decryption GUI

This C++ project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for file encryption and decryption, employing a simple method of toggling ASCII values. The application allows users to select a file, input a password, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the file. The encryption and decryption operations involve manipulating the ASCII values of each character.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI:** The project comes with an intuitive graphical interface, making it easy for users to interact with the application.

- **File Selection:** Users can select the file they want to encrypt or decrypt through a straightforward file selection process.

- **Password Input:** The program prompts users to enter a password, which is crucial for the encryption and decryption processes.

- **Encryption and Decryption:** Choose between encrypting or decrypting a selected file. The encryption and decryption functions are based on a method that involves toggling ASCII values.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the compiled C++ program to launch the GUI.

2. **Selection:**
   - Click on the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button.
     
3. **File Name Input:**
   - Enter a name of file that you want to encrypt or decrypt.

3. **Password Input:**
   - Enter a secure password. This password will be used for both encryption and decryption, so remember it.

4. **Choose Operation:**
   - Decide whether to encrypt or decrypt the selected file using the provided options.

5. **Execute Operation:**
   - Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to perform the chosen operation on the selected file.

6. **View Results:**
   - The program will display the results of the operation, indicating the success or failure of the encryption or decryption process.
